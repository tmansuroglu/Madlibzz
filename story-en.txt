This weekend my gap[n] is taking me camping. We go every year to the same spot as it's very gap[a] and the views are gap[a] from the top of the gap[n]. We build a fire which is where we cook our gap[a] food. I love toasting pluralgap[pn] over the fire, they taste very gap[a]. When you're camping you have to watch out for pluralgap[pn] and pluralgap[pn]. It is very gap[a] in the tent at night so it is best to remember to bring a gap[n].
